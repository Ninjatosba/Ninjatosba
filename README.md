# 👋 Hi, I'm Deniz

I’m a backend and smart contract engineer working across the **Cosmos** and **EVM** ecosystems. My work focuses on **financial protocols**, **content platforms**, and **contract-driven backend workflows**. I’ve shipped production systems used by creators, communities, and live applications on multiple chains. I currently lead smart contract development at **OmniFlix Network**, where I design on-chain workflows, indexing pipelines, and upgrade/migration processes for high-volume platforms.

### **Core Skills**
- **Smart Contracts:** Rust (CosmWasm), Solidity  
- **Backend:** TypeScript/Node.js, Rust, Actix-Web, REST services, indexing pipelines  
- **Blockchains:** Cosmos SDK, Ethereum/EVM  
- **Tooling:** Hardhat, Ethers.js, Subgraph, MongoDB

### **Selected Work**
- **StreamSwap (Cosmos & EVM):** streaming payments, deterministic settlement logic, Subgraph indexing  
- **OmniFlix Channel Contracts:** channels, publishing, playlists, metadata, creator workflows  
- **NFT Launchpad (CosmWasm):** collection creation, sale mechanics, high-volume minting flows  
- **Dutch Auction Module:** timed on-chain price discovery with clean off-chain tooling

I focus on **correctness, predictable state transitions, and clean integration between contracts and backend services**.
